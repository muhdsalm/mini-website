# A potential redesigned website for the Mini language</div>
<br>
<br>


## Mini
According to the website:
> Mini is an attempt to create the simplest naturalistic language for human communication conceived by S.C. Gruget in 2020.

> With simple phonetics, inflectionless grammar, and a global vocabulary of exactly 1,000 words, Mini is ideal for use as an international auxiliary language. 


## This website
This website is _not_ the official Mini website, although if the author gives this his attention it may one day be. For now, it's just a pet project. It's live at [a test URL](https://muhdsalm.github.io)


## Technical details
This website uses 11ty, which is a static site generator. This entire website is, in fact, fully static. The reason for this is that there's no reason for it to have any dynamic parts, and static websites have the fastest load times and are the most efficient.

## Building from source.
To build this website, first clone the repo (or fork it if you want to contribute), then install all the dependencies, including 11ty, using the command
```npm install```

If you want to run 11ty in watch mode, for development, run
```npm start```
and navigate to https://localhost:8080

If you want to build a production version, run:
```npm run build```
